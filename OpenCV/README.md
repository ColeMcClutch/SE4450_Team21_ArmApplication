OpenCV:
Stable and runs pretty good. 
The camera feed faces no problems and encompasses the objects in front of it pretty well. â€˜
Unfortunately, it relies on classes for identifying objects. This is noticed when I needed to write the classes for objects it could find.
It will require lots of class additions for the objects we could work with.
