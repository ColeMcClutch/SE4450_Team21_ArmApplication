Yolo:
Contains pros and cons when compared to OpenCV.
The Yolo model doesn’t need classes/objects written down for what could be placed in front of it
It also has a better camera range as it can detect more objects in the frame.
It also does quite as good a job as OpenCV for outlining the objects and labelling them.
But there are a couple noticeable flaws.
The camera itself is a little slower relaying the back it sees to the screen
The program itself also takes a bit long to load.
One other final note is while it doesn’t require a range of objects for recognition, it can’t quite recognize everything. For example, it labelled a pencil as a toothbrush
